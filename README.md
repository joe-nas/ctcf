# CTCF-motif directionality controls CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions and correlates with topological domain structure
## R scripts and data files containing the analysis worklof and results

### R scripts:

#### topological_domains.R
contains the data analysis workflow used in the report. E.g creation of naively created loops and loops under constraints like motive directionality and length. Furthermore, a workflow to check if particular ctcf loop types cross topological domain borders.

#### within_loop_analysis.R


- utility_functions.R

### R data:

- ctcf_bs_motif_orientation.R
- simulated_loops.Rdata
- simulated_loops_motif_matched.Rdata
